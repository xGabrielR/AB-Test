<h3>0.1. Eletronic House Company</h3>

Customers can purchase from smaller equipment such as mice, headphones and hdmi cables to computers and laptops through the company's website, after purchase the products arrive in the comfort of their homes.</p>

<h4>0.1.1. Conversion Rate Lift</h4>
<p>The ux designers team has been working on a new sales page with the objective of increasing the sales rate of a product in the store, this product is the bluetooth keyboard. The product manager said that the average page conversion rate is 13% and he expects a 2% increase in conversion from the new page being developed.</p>
<p>The bluetooth keyboard can be purchased for 4,500 in cash or 12 interest-free installments on your credit card.</p>
<p>But before actually changing the page when it is developed, the product manager would like to test the effectiveness of the page on a smaller group of customers in order to avoid possible drops in conversion or whatever other problems the page may have in production.</p>
<p>Before the new page goes into production, it will be tested on a smaller group of customers in order to avoid risks such as a drop in conversion and others, but it will be possible for this smaller group to calculate the potential and expected revenue rates of this new page!</p>

<h5>0.1.1.1. Metric Definition</h5>
